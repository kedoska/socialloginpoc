# Expo app + Azure Socket.io ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) that demonstrates how to connect to a [Socket.io](https://socket.io) server hosted on Azure. More info at [Quickstart: Incorporate Web PubSub for Socket.IO in your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-web-pubsub/socketio-quickstart)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

# Run the app

- `node server.js "<connection-string>"`
